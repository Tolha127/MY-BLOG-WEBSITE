                <h3>Difference between HTML3 and HTML5</h3>
                <p>📝 Blog Post Summary: "The Difference Between HTML5 and HTML3"
                    In this post, we explore the evolution from HTML3 to HTML5, highlighting how the web has grown from
                    simple structure to
                    rich, interactive experiences.

                    You’ll discover:

                    What HTML3 was capable of back in the early web days

                    How HTML5 revolutionized web development with audio, video, semantic tags, and responsiveness

                <h3>My experience on the path of becoming a software engineer </a></h3>
                <p>📝 Blog Post Summary: "My Experience on the Path of Becoming a Software Engineer"
                    In this personal piece, I open up about my journey from curious beginner to determined
                    developer—learning to code,
                    navigating setbacks, and staying consistent through it all.

                    You’ll get a real look into:

                    How I started with HTML & CSS and worked my way into JavaScript, React, and Backend

                    The emotional highs and lows of self-teaching and online bootcamps

                    Balancing university life, faith, and passion projects

                    The mindset shifts that helped me stay on track and keep improving

                    This isn't just about code—it's about growth, grit, and purpose.

                    the dev dream with

                <h3>Majarona I: A New Dawn in Tech & the Reawakening of Our Species</a></h3>
                <p>📝 Blog Post Summary: "Majarona I: A New Dawn in Tech & the Reawakening of Our Species"
                    This post marks the beginning of a visionary series—Majarona—where I reflect on how technological
                    evolution is reshaping
                    not just our tools, but our very nature as humans.

                    In this first chapter, I explore:

                    The spiritual and philosophical ties between creation, intelligence, and invention

                    How tech isn't just making life easier—but pushing us to redefine purpose, identity, and connection

                    Why understanding our species deeply is essential as we create machines in our own image

                    A call to balance innovation with intention, so that tech doesn’t outgrow our humanity

                    This isn't your average tech blog—it’s a soulful journey through code, consciousness, and creation.
